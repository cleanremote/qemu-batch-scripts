# qemu-batch-scripts
This contains batch scripts to easily run the qemu program. HERES THE CATCH!! You MUST have the qemu directory on your desktop or it WILL NOT work. (I just downloaded the installer, extracted it using 7zip, and then renamed the folder qemu and put it on my desktop) when you open the folder (without clicking on subfolders) you should see the qemu-systm files
